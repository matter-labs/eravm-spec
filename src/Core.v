# EraVM architecture overview


EraVM is a 256-bit register-based language machine with stack, dedicated memory for code, data, stack and constants.

- **Memory**, provides access to transient memory, consisting of pages. See [%Memory].
- **Storage**, provides access to persistent storage with two shards, each shard maps $2^{160}$ contracts, to a key-value storage. See [%Memory] and [%Storage].
- **EventSink**, collects events and L2â†’L1 messages. See [%Events].
- **Precompile processor** executes precompiles e.g. `keccak256`, `sha256`, and so on. See [%Precompiles].
- **Decommittement processor**, stores and decommits the code of contracts. See [%Decommitter].


## Execution state

EraVM's functionality is to sequentially execute instructions.

The main components of EraVM's execution state are:

- 256-bit tagged general-purpose registers R1--R15 and a reserved register R0 holding a constant 0. See [%GPR.regs_state].
- Three flags: overflow/less-than, equals, greater-than. See [%Condition.flags_state].
- Callstack, holding callframes, which include program counter, stack pointer, current ergs balance, current contract's address, and so on. See [%CallStack].
- Frames in callstack can be internal (belong to a function, near called) frames or external frames (belong to a contract, far called, richer state).
- Stack holding tagged words.
- Read-only pages for constants and code, one per contract stack frame.


## Operation

Refer to the section [%Instructions] for the list of supported instructions.

All instructions contain an encoded execution condition ([%instruction_predicated]). It means that before executing any instruction flags are checked, and if they do not match the required condition, the instruction is skipped.

VM has two modes which can be independently turned on and off.

1. Kernel mode

  First [%KERNEL_MODE_MAXADDR_LIMIT] contracts are marked as system contracts.
  VM executes them in kernel mode, allowing an access to a richer instruction set, containing instructions potentially harmful to the global state e.g. [%OpContextIncrementTxNumber]. See [%KernelMode].

2. Static mode

   Intuitively, executing code in static mode aims at limiting its effects on
   the global state, similar to executing pure functions. Globally visible
   actions like emitting events or writing to storage are forbidden in static
   mode. See [%StaticMode].

## Contracts

Instructions and some other actions should be paid for with **ergs**, an analogue of gas. See the overview in [%Ergs].
